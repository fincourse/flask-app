00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,533
In this video,

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,480
we'll look at the concept of a data practitioner and discuss the various roles

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,560
and responsibilities of those working in the world of data. Let's begin.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,193
Simply put,

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,380
a data practitioner is anyone who works with data In some capacity,

6
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,160
data have become an integral part of our daily lives,

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,730
and we are all data users in some way. Whether we're completing digital forms,

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,290
managing budgets, using a spreadsheet,

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,290
or saving and sharing content on social media platforms,

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,510
we're all data practitioners in our own right. In a professional setting.

11
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,790
A data practitioner supports different stages in an organization's data science

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,030
process. This involves defining problems and requirements,

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,110
collecting and cleaning data, exploratory data analysis,

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,550
gathering and reporting insights, building models, and deploying them.

15
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,810
The world of data is diverse and a range of skills is needed to successfully

16
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,010
extract value from data.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,870
Let's explore some common roles of data professionals.

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,150
A data strategist is responsible for helping a company to understand how it can

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,670
effectively leverage data to drive business value.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,950
They define measurable goals and objectives while working closely with

21
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,590
stakeholders and the data team to develop a plan that aligns a data strategy to

22
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,930
the organization's needs. Once a data strategy is in place,

23
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,530
a data architect uses it to design the blueprints for an organization's data

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,770
infrastructure to address its data needs.

25
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,540
This involves defining policies, procedures,

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,740
and models for company data collection, storage and access.

27
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,060
Next,

28
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,980
a data engineer actualizes the data architect's blueprints and sets up data

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,740
pipelines ensuring the required data are available for other data professionals

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,780
in the organization.

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,330
Data engineers work closely with data scientists and analysts to understand the

32
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,770
data requirements and design and build the E T L process,

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,050
which stands for extract, transform, and Load.

34
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,150
The E T L process involves retrieving data from various sources,

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,870
processing it into usable formats,

36
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,670
and finally moving it into a storage destination that can be accessed by others.

37
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,330
A data analyst uses this process data to extract meaningful

38
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,330
insights and trends that can bring value to a business.

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,650
They organize and explore the data and then present their analysis, findings,

40
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,090
and insights to stakeholders using reports and dashboards.

41
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,260
Advanced coding skills are not always a requirement for data analysts.

42
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,380
A business intelligence analyst or bi analyst takes on a reporting

43
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,540
role in an organization.

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,500
They assess and present on the performance of the organization using dashboards

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,380
and key performance indicators or KPIs.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,330
They then turn these insights into actionable results that help to improve the

47
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,610
company's overall performance. For this reason,

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,730
they need a deep understanding of the business domain.

49
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,690
A data scientist is a data practitioner who investigates and interprets data to

50
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,610
solve real world problems and support business objectives.

51
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,920
Unlike data analysts and BI analysts,

52
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,960
data scientists use a more technical approach with advanced analytic tools and

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,120
techniques such as statistical modeling and machine learning.

54
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,910
They primarily use programming languages and frameworks when working with data.

55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,580
A machine learning engineer is responsible for building and deploying machine

56
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,180
learning models that learn from data and helping making predictions or

57
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,380
supporting the decisions of an organization.

58
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,590
Machine learning engineers exclusively use programming languages and frameworks

59
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,750
to perform their duties

60
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,610
in the ever evolving world of data organizations'.

61
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,050
Data needs are always changing, and as a result,

62
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,210
specialized data walls that cater to these changing needs are constantly

63
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,363
emerging.

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,300
The different stages of the data lifecycle are usually interconnected,

65
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,460
and so data roles commonly overlap. Therefore,

66
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,540
data professionals should try to develop a diverse skillset to enable them to

67
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,380
adapt and collaborate effectively across different roles.

68
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,623
In this video,

69
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,690
we defined the concept of a data practitioner and looked at some of the roles

70
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,890
played by various data professionals in the industry. See you in the next one.
